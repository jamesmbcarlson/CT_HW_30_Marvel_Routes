# Marvel API
Author: James Carlson

This project was made for an assignment for Coding Temple.

Using the official [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/), I created an application where the user can browse through Marvel characters, and select a character to learn more information. Likewise, users can browse through Marvel comics and select a comic to learn more.
